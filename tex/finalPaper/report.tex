%  Introduction section: describe the problem you are trying to solve, in 5-7 sentences. It is
% understood that this text may change in the final report, but it doesnâ€™t need to.
% (c) Introduction section: describe the papers that you have read and used to inform your work
% here. Create a bibliography containing these references, and include some sentences on how
% these papers are related and how you used them to build your project. If you used an online
% resource (such as a tf.agents tutorial or something similar) as a starting point, you should
% include that as a reference also.
% (d) Introduction section: describe the data you have for this problem. For example, how many
% training/validation/test samples do you have? What are the dimensionalities of the inputs and
% outputs? If an RL problem, what are the details of the states/actions/rewards?
% (e) Methods section: what is your starting point? For example, will a simple logistic regression
% get you started? What approaches already exist to solve this problem, and how difficult are
% they to implement? Describe in 3-5 sentences what first steps you have taken to start from
% something simple and move to more complex networks. This progression, as we have discussed
% in class on several occasions, is critical to empiricism and working with deep learning.
% (f) Methods section: what architectures/problem setups will you try to get you from this simple
% method to your end goal? For example, will you use dropout or batch normalization, will you
% implement a custom tf.agent, or otherwise? Note it is not necessary to make these choices
% final; this part is about showing progress.
% (g) Results section: what results do you intend to incluude, and why will they demonstrate success?
% Add a list of your intended results and what you hope they will show. If you have early results,
% you may include figures demonstrating the results (optional).
% (h) Discussion section: what are the important takeaways from your work? what problems/opportunity
% for further work (after the semester) do you see for this project? Some of this section will be
% incomplete or speculative since the project is still underway, and that is acceptable (of course
% it should be complete upon final project submission).
